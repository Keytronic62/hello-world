My personal repository

Hello world!
This is my personal repository. I am totally new to Github and have almost no experience in coding. I used to write some simple HTML codes and have used VBA in Excel quite frequently in the past. Besides that I am a total newb.

Here I will save all the files and information which helps me learn more about coding.
